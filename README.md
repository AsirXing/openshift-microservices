# OpenShift Examples - Microservices
Microservices, also known as the microservice architecture, is a software development technique that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Microservice architectures enable the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications.

This git repo showcases an app built using the microservice architecture with several intentionally simple components. The goal is to showcase an example way to develop and manage microservices using OpenShift. However, this example is not meant to be prescriptive - obviously your team and business goals will drive your specific architecture and environment. The technology should translate and hopefully you will find this repo helpful.

Here's what it looks like:
