# A Circuit breaker implementation that tracks the status of each individual
# host in the upstream service. Applicable to both HTTP and TCP services. 
# For HTTP services, hosts that continually return 5xx errors for API calls 
# are ejected from the pool for a pre-defined period of time. For TCP services,
# connection timeouts or connection failures to a given host counts as an error
# when measuring the consecutive errors metric. See Envoyâ€™s outlier detection
# for more details.
#
# The following rule sets a connection pool size of 2 connections and 5 
# concurrent HTTP2 requests, with no more than 2 req/connection to "boards" 
# service. In addition, it configures upstream hosts to be scanned every 5 mins, 
# such that any host that fails 2 consecutive times with 5XX error code will be
# ejected for 15 minutes.
# 
# Note: we are making these numbers a bit small for demo purposes
