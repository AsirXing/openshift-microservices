# 3Scale setup
The latest official install guide can be found here:
[TBD](1). 

Note that if you are using Istio too, you can leverage the 3scale adapter by [following instructions here](3).

The simple version is:
1) Update the environment variables in 3scale-install.sh with the appropriate values. The OCP_ROUTE variable should be set to the wildcard domain of your cluster
2) Make sure you are `oc login`-ed as a cluster admin
3) Run ./3scale-install.sh
4) The install will update the openshift router to enable wildcard routing. More information can be found [here](4). With wildcard routing enabled, you don't have to manually create openshift routes for every API 3scale
5) Make sure you save all the credentials that were generated by the install
